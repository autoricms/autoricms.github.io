        <p>I get butterflies in my stomach every time I think of you, since I have always considered you to be my better half. When the weather is good, I cannot help thinking of us sitting together under the trees with a sun hat on your head and your beautiful smile on your cute face. You are someone who brings light into my world, which makes me a lucky guy.What more can I say? It is so hard to find the words to describe how much you mean to me. You started as my girlfriend and now I can say that there is no life without you. You are a gift of God that He has given to me, and I want to say thank you for always being by my side and making life worth living.<br>Happy Birthday my zhigiric</p>
